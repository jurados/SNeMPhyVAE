## Abstract
---
The arrival of new large telescopes such as the LSST and the enormous amounts of data they will produce require the development of more efficient computational techniques. Some efforts have already been made, such as the Parsnip model developed by Boone K. (2021), to classify and characterize different types of transient events. However, we know that the use of a single time series is not sufficient to accomplish this task completely. Our research aims to develop a Variational Autoencoder model, applying the new idea of multimodality and its advantages, to classify and characterize different types of transient events in more detail. This model will use three different modalities as inputs: light curves, spectra and photometric velocities. Data will be extracted from various sources: observations, simulations and inference methods. We will use latent space and a latent space function to perform the classification and characterization tasks, respectively. Finally, we will compare the computational time and inferred physical parameters with other model parameters.
